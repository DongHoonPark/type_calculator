## *Calculator for engineers who deal with frustrating mixed types*


Thanks to the great improvement of computing hardware, most of the software engineers in 2021 had been escaped from the curse of fixed-point. Hardware engineers, however, who could not ignore the advantages of fixed-point are struggle to fight to make an *efficient* solution with this monster. 

Sadly, when we deal with fixed point, we cannot directly read the binary or hex to a real recognizable number! We are not a Von Neumann!

It's why I have developed this website. I would be really happy if this tool can provide convenience  to other people.

Thanks to [GitHub](https://github.com/) for hosting.

Thanks to [Koh Young Technology](https://www.kohyoung.com) for giving me a development idea.

Star *really* encourage me!
